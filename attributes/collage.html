    <p>I walked into SRM with butterflies in my stomach—new city, new faces, big dreams. Over the semesters I stumbled through lectures, aced some labs, made friends over late night mess food, and pulled all nighters before exams. I joined a club, helped with fest events, laughed, felt overwhelmed sometimes, but always found my way. In the end, I left with more confidence, memories I couldnt forget, and hope for what comes next.</p>
