                <h1>My Hometown</h1>
                <p>Childhood in Kanchipuram was filled with the warm scent of jasmine and the sound of temple bells ringing in the distance. Mornings meant running through narrow lanes with friends, chasing each other past vibrant markets and old, weathered houses. The streets were always alive with color — from the sarees in the shops to the fruits in the stalls. The days were simple, filled with laughter, stories, and the joy of discovering something new around every corner</p>

                        <p>I still remember the day I first saw someone build a simple web page with just a few lines of code — it felt like magic. Curious, I started exploring on my own, writing tiny programs, breaking them, and fixing them again. The more I learned, the more I wanted to create. That spark turned into passion — and coding became my favorite language</p>
