        <h2>My School</h2>
        <p>School life at Swami Vivekananda School was simple and full of memories. Mornings began with assembly and inspiring thoughts. In class, teachers taught with discipline and care. Recess meant laughter under the banyan tree and sharing snacks with friends. Sports days were filled with cheers and excitement. Those days may be gone, but the lessons and friendships still remain close to your heart</p>
